### Pong ###

#### The classic Pong game written in Javascript is my current side project ####

***So this is a work-in-progress and I am using my free time to try and build a fully functional game in pure JS.***

***Why I'm building this:*** I am building on the knowledge gained from my bootcamp and familiarising myself with not only Vanilla JS but also writing object-oriented code also.

##### How to run the game #####

clone the repo 
```
https://github.com/kevprice83/Pong-JS.git
```
run the server from the directory
```
ruby -run -e httpd . -p 5000
```
now open up your browser and go to ```localhost:5000```

***Controls for the Left player are the W and S keys, for the Right player use the O and L keys***

Enjoy the game!
